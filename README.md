# My_Scrum
I have developed a simple scrum board, which helps to increase our productivity by distributing our tasks and prioritizing them. 
We can add our tasks in three basic categories - "to do " , "in progress" and "completed". We can simply drag and drop the tasks from one category to other with respect to its status.
